#ASL+

ASL+ is an ASL interpreter with a smaller-than-typical dataset, however it builds its precision on the carefully selected and diverse training data. It implements computer vision from OpenCV, and uses TensorFlow's Object Detection API for identification. Thanks to Nicholas Renotte for the idea!
